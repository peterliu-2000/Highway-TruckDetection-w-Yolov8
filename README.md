**Overview**

This simple program utilizes the advanced object recognition algorithm Yolov8 by Team Ultralytics (made public on Jan 2023) and was developed as a individual project during my research internship at Shanxi Intelligence Transport research institute at Shanxi, China in July - August 2023. The program is developed to recognize (from uploaded videos or in real-time) large/tarpaulin-covered trucks and oil tankers in highways as they are more likely to be involved in accident. It is presented through a easily-guided user interface (PySimpleGUI) to facilitate its potential industrial applications

**Files**

The project was programmed in Python 3.10 environment The main program is contained in _main.py_, and the rest of the Python files contain supporting functions and should be downloaded in the same pathway with main if one should use it. myWeights.pt contains the neuro network trained specifically for identifying large trucks/oil tanks in Shanxi highway.
